  # Replays the frozen negative-JWT corpus in test/fixtures/jwt_corpus/
  # against Attesto.Token.verify/3 and asserts each token produces exactly
  # the error atom its companion `.json` records (or `{:ok, _}` for the lone
  # resource-exhaustion fixture that must verify rather than crash).
  #
  # Where the surrounding suite round-trips through Token.mint/3, these
  # fixtures are *frozen bytes* a mint helper can never emit - non-URL-safe
  # base64, non-UTF-8 payloads, control characters in the JSON, padding
  # remnants, segment-count anomalies, hand-planted `crit`/`kid` attacks.
  # They pin the wire-level contract so a parser regression surfaces as a
  # corpus failure here rather than a silently changed code path. See the
  # corpus README for the layout and the per-group expected-error table.
  #
  # The corpus was signed with a fixed key (signing_key.pem) and minted
  # against a frozen clock; the config below mirrors the one it was produced
  # under (Factory.config/1 - same issuer/audience and client/user principal
  # kinds), and every fixture is verified with `now: @frozen_now`. The module
  # installs that key into the Attesto.Keystore.Static singleton, so it is
  # `async: false`.
