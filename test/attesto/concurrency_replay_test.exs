  # Targeted races against the expiry boundary of the DPoP replay cache.
  #
  # `Attesto.ConcurrencySwarmTest` floods the *happy* CAS: a fresh jti seen
  # by N racers at once must admit exactly one winner. This suite drives the
  # harder, easily-overlooked branch in `ReplayCache.check_and_record/2`
  # (replay_cache.ex lines 114-125): the `:ets.insert_new/2` lost, the entry
  # already exists, AND it has just expired. There the cache *replaces* the
  # stale row and accepts (lines 118-121) instead of reporting :replay. That
  # replace-on-expiry path is the only way a previously-seen jti is ever
  # re-admitted, so its concurrency and its TTL semantics both need proof:
  #
  #   1. Expiry-boundary swap race - many racers hit a jti that expired
  #      mid-swarm. The branch is a read-then-write (lookup, then insert),
  #      NOT an atomic insert_new, so the invariant is weaker than the happy
  #      path: at most one racer may take the replace-and-accept path. We
  #      prove no two racers both replace-and-accept, i.e. an expired jti is
  #      never re-admitted more than once by a single contended swap.
  #
  #   2. TTL re-use after expiry - a jti recorded with ttl_seconds: 1, then
  #      flooded (all :replay within the window), is re-insertable once the
  #      TTL has actually elapsed. This is the user-visible contract the
  #      replay_cache contract encodes: a jti is forgotten after its TTL.
  #
  # The cache is a named ETS-backed GenServer singleton; starting it mutates
  # VM-global state and the table is shared, so this suite is async: false
  # and resets the table between tests.
