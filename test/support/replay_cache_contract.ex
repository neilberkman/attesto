  @moduledoc false
  # Reusable conformance suite for any DPoP replay-check callback.
  #
  # Unlike `Attesto.CodeStoreContract` / `Attesto.RefreshStoreContract`,
  # the thing under test here is NOT a behaviour module with named
  # functions - it is a *callback value*. `Attesto.DPoP.verify_proof/2`
  # accepts `:replay_check` as any `(jti, ttl_seconds) -> :ok |
  # {:error, :replay}` fun (RFC 9449 §11.1 lets a deployment swap the
  # node-local `Attesto.DPoP.ReplayCache` ETS singleton for a shared store
  # - Postgres `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, Redis `SET NX PX`, etc.
  # - so that replay rejection holds across the whole deployment, not just
  # per node). This contract pins the invariants every such replacement
  # must satisfy, so the ETS reference today and a SQL-backed store
  # tomorrow are held to the identical record-once / reject-replay /
  # expire-and-readmit guarantees that DPoP proof-replay defence rests on.
  #
  # ## Options
  #
  #   * `:check` (required) - a 0-arity fun returning the
  #     `(jti, ttl_seconds) -> :ok | {:error, :replay}` callback under
  #     test, freshly resolved inside each test (so it observes the state
  #     started by `:start`). For the ETS reference this is simply
  #     `fn -> &Attesto.DPoP.ReplayCache.check_and_record/2 end`.
  #   * `:start` (optional) - a 0-arity fun that starts whatever backing
  #     state the callback needs (a GenServer, a connection, a fresh table)
  #     and returns its pid (or anything; the return is ignored). When
  #     omitted, no setup is run - use this only for a stateless callback
  #     that needs none.
  #
  # The reference implementation is a named singleton GenServer over a
  # VM-global ETS table, so the host case MUST be
  # `use ExUnit.Case, async: false`.
  #
  #     defmodule MyReplayCheckContractTest do
  #       use ExUnit.Case, async: false
  #
  #       use Attesto.ReplayCacheContract,
  #         start: fn ->
  #           start_supervised!(
  #             {Attesto.DPoP.ReplayCache,
  #              ttl_seconds: 60, multi_node_acknowledged?: true}
  #           )
  #         end,
  #         check: fn -> &Attesto.DPoP.ReplayCache.check_and_record/2 end
  #     end
  #
  # ## On the TTL-expiry test
  #
  # The expiry invariant (a `jti` whose TTL has elapsed is re-admittable)
  # is the gap this contract closes versus the pre-existing
  # `dpop_test.exs` coverage, which only exercised same-process replay
  # within the window. The expiry test passes `ttl_seconds: 1` and sleeps
  # past it in real time; `Attesto.DPoP.ReplayCache` keys expiry off
  # `System.monotonic_time/1`, so wall-clock sleeping advances it. It is
  # tagged `:slow` so a fast inner loop can exclude it; a backing store
  # whose smallest practical TTL is coarser than one second can also
  # exclude it and assert expiry by its own clock.
