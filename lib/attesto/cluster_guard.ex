defmodule Attesto.ClusterGuard do
  @moduledoc """
  Refuse to start a per-node ETS store on a clustered BEAM.

  Attesto's engine is pure and stateless, so it is cluster-safe by
  construction. The *state* (authorization codes, refresh-token families,
  seen DPoP `jti` values, DPoP nonces) lives behind storage behaviours
  whose contracts mandate atomic operations; a host implements them over a
  shared store (Postgres, Redis) for a multi-node deployment.

  The bundled ETS reference implementations are deliberately **single-node**:
  a captured code/token/proof would be replayable once per node if a second
  node held its own ETS copy, silently breaking single-use, reuse
  detection, and replay rejection. Rather than let that misconfiguration go
  unnoticed, every ETS store calls `assert_single_node!/2` at boot and
  **raises** if the BEAM is already clustered, unless the operator has
  explicitly acknowledged that they have wired a shared store and set the
  per-store `:multi_node_acknowledged?` option.
