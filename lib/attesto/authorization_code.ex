defmodule Attesto.AuthorizationCode do
  @moduledoc """
  RFC 6749 §4.1 authorization-code grant, with mandatory PKCE (RFC 7636,
  S256) and optional DPoP binding of the code (RFC 9449 §10).

  This module is pure logic over a `Attesto.CodeStore`: `issue/3` mints a
  single-use code at the authorization endpoint, `redeem/4` validates and
  consumes it at the token endpoint and returns the grant context the host
  uses to mint an access token. The store decides where codes live and
  guarantees single use; everything validated here (expiry, exact
  redirect-URI match, the PKCE transform, the DPoP key binding) is
  protocol.

  ## PKCE (S256), required by default

  `issue/3` accepts a valid S256 `code_challenge` and `redeem/4` checks the
  matching `code_verifier`; only S256 is accepted (see `Attesto.PKCE`). This
  closes authorization-code interception and is the modern default (OAuth 2.0
  Security BCP / RFC 9700). PKCE enforcement at the authorization endpoint is
  governed by `Attesto.AuthorizationRequest`'s `:require_pkce` option (default
  `true`); a host MAY relax it for a *confidential* client (public clients MUST
  use PKCE, RFC 9700 §2.1.1), in which case a code is issued with no challenge
  and redeemed with no verifier. A `code_challenge` that is present is always
  fully enforced. `issue/3` therefore treats `:code_challenge` as optional: when
  given it must be a valid S256 challenge, when absent the code is unbound and a
  later redemption MUST present no `code_verifier`.

  ## Single use even on failure

  `redeem/4` consumes the code via `c:Attesto.CodeStore.take/1` **before**
  validating it, so a presented code is spent whether or not the
  redemption succeeds. An attacker who captures a code cannot make
  repeated validation attempts against it.

  ## Code-reuse detection (when the store supports it)

  Single use alone cannot distinguish a *replay of an already-redeemed
  code* from a *never-issued code*: once `take/1` removes the row, both
  look absent. OAuth 2.0 Security BCP §4.13 (and RFC 6749 §4.1.2) say the
  AS SHOULD, on a second presentation of a code, revoke the tokens already
  issued from its first redemption, because a re-presented code is an
  attack signal.

  `redeem/4` enables that when - and only when - the `Attesto.CodeStore`
  implements the optional reuse-tracking pair (`c:Attesto.CodeStore.take/1`
  returning `{:error, :consumed, meta}` plus
  `c:Attesto.CodeStore.mark_consumed/2`). The reuse marker is recorded by
  `finalize/3`, which the caller invokes AFTER the full token response has been
  successfully built - NOT by `redeem/4` itself. So a code whose redemption
  validated but whose downstream issuance then failed (a mint or refresh-token
  fault, a host callback returning a bad principal) is left single-use-spent
  but NOT reuse-flagged: a replay is `{:error, :invalid_grant}`, and a
  legitimate retry of a transient failure is never mistaken for a reuse attack
  (which would wrongly revoke the family). Once `finalize/3` has run, a later
  redemption of the same code yields `{:error, {:reuse, meta}}`, where `meta`
  carries that first redemption's context so the caller can revoke the
  descendant family (e.g. via `Attesto.Revocation`). A store that does not
  implement the pair behaves exactly as before: a re-presented code is
  `{:error, :invalid_grant}`.
  This is additive and fail-safe (see `Attesto.CodeStore`).

  Pass a `:family_id` to `issue/3` to link the code to the refresh-token
  family it will spawn; it rides onto the returned `Grant` so the host
  mints the family under that id, and it is what reuse detection replays.

  ## DPoP-bound codes

  If `issue/3` is given a `:dpop_jkt`, the code is bound to that DPoP key
  (RFC 9449 §10): redemption MUST present the same `:dpop_jkt` (the
  thumbprint of the key in the token-request's DPoP proof) or it is
  rejected. A code minted without a binding MAY still be redeemed with a
  token-request DPoP proof; in that case this module treats the proof as a
  token-endpoint sender constraint for the access token the host is about to
  mint, not as a pre-existing authorization-code binding.

  Validate and consume a code at the token endpoint.

  `params` MUST carry the `:redirect_uri` (matched exactly against the one
  in the authorization request), the `:code_verifier` (checked against the
  stored PKCE challenge), and the `:client_id` of the redeeming client. By
  default client binding is fail-closed: since every stored code carries a
  `client_id`, redemption MUST present one (`:client_required` if absent,
  `:client_mismatch` if wrong) - this stops a code issued to one client
  being redeemed by another (RFC 6749 §4.1.3). A caller that cannot
  authenticate the client and relies on PKCE alone passes
  `allow_missing_client_id?: true` in `opts`. `:dpop_jkt` is required iff
  the code was DPoP-bound at `issue/3`; if the code was not bound, a presented
  `:dpop_jkt` is allowed and can be used by the caller to mint a DPoP-bound
  access token.

  `{:ok, %Attesto.AuthorizationCode.Grant{}}` with the validated grant
  context, or `{:error, reason}`.
