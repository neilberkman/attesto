defmodule Attesto.Thumbprint do
  @moduledoc """
  Canonical SHA-256 thumbprint shape, shared across the sender-constraint
  schemes.

  Three different specs converge on the same 32-byte-digest-as-base64url
  shape:

    * RFC 7638 JWK thumbprints (DPoP `cnf.jkt`),
    * RFC 8705 §3.1 X.509 certificate thumbprints (`cnf.x5t#S256`), and
    * the RFC 7515 §4.1.8 `x5t#S256` JOSE header parameter.

  In every case the value is

      Base.url_encode64(<32-byte SHA-256 digest>, padding: false)

  which is exactly 43 characters drawn from the RFC 4648 §5 alphabet
  `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`.

  ## Why 43 base64url characters is necessary but not sufficient

  The last character of a 43-character base64url-no-pad string encodes
  only the final 4 bits of the 256-bit digest, so its low 2 bits are
  structurally zero. A 43-character string whose last character carries
  non-zero trailing bits is therefore **not** something
  `Base.url_encode64/2` could ever have produced. Accepting such a value
  as a thumbprint would let a caller embed a `cnf` binding that no real
  key or certificate could ever match - silently turning a
  sender-constraint into a no-op. `valid?/1` rejects these by decoding
  and re-encoding: a value is canonical iff it round-trips to itself and
  decodes to exactly 32 bytes.
